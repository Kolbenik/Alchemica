# ⚗️ Alchemica: The Survivor's Guide

Welcome to **Alchemica**, a mod where science meets the occult. There are no GUIs here—only you, a cauldron, and the consequences of your actions.

## 1. The Basics: The Ritual Site
To begin, you need three things:
1.  **Campfire** (Lit)
2.  **Cauldron** (Placed directly above the campfire)
3.  **Water Bucket** (Fill the cauldron)
4.  **Stick** (Your stirring tool)

## 2. Alchemy & Transmutation
Alchemy is the art of changing matter. To perform a transmutation:
1.  Throw the ingredients into the boiling water.
2.  Right-click the cauldron with your **Stick**.
3.  **Risk:** Some recipes (like Iron to Gold) are unstable. They have a **50% chance** to fail, producing useless **Alchemical Ash** instead.

### Known Recipes:
* **Gold Ingot:** 1 Iron Ingot + 1 Gold Nugget (50% Risk)
* **Vinegar:** 1 Apple + 1 Glass Bottle (Safe)
* **Alcohol:** 1 Vinegar + 1 Sugar (Safe)

## 3. Distillation & Preservation
Food rots. If you keep raw food in your inventory for too long, it will turn into **Rotten Flesh**. To survive, you must pickle your food.

### The Vinegar Cauldron
1.  Craft **Vinegar**.
2.  Right-click a **Water Cauldron** with the Vinegar bottle.
3.  The water will turn yellow-ish (Vinegar Mode).
4.  Throw **Raw Food** (Apples, Beef, Pork) into the vinegar.
5.  **Result:** The food pops out with a blue "Preserved" tag. It will never rot.
6.  *Note: Each bottle of vinegar can preserve 4 items before the cauldron empties.*

## 4. Atmospheric Decay (Rust)
Iron is weak against the elements.
* **Inventory:** If you hold Iron Ingots in the rain, they will slowly corrode.
* **World:** Dropping Iron Ingots into water (rivers/oceans) will rust them into **Copper Ingots** after 60 seconds.
* **Blocks:** Use **Alchemical Ash** on an Iron Block to chemically corrode it into a **Rusted Iron Block**.

## 5. The Antenna
Silence is dangerous. You cannot use the Chat without an **Antenna** in your inventory. Craft one immediately to re-establish contact with the server.
